            <h3>Plot</h3>
            <p class="text-light">
                Sometime after the defeat of Majin Buu, peace has 
                returned to Earth. Goku has settled down and works 
                as a farmer to support his family. His family and 
                friends live peaceful lives. However, a new 
                threat appears in the form of the God of Destruction
                named Beerus, who is considered to be the most 
                terrifying and the second most powerful being in 
                Universe Seven. After awakening from decades of 
                slumber, Beerus tells his Angel assistant and teacher
                named Whis that he is eager to fight the legendary 
                warrior whom he had seen in a prophecy known as the Super
                Saiyan God (超スーパーサイヤ人ゴッド Sūpā Saiya-jin Goddo).
                To protect Earth, Goku transforms into the Super Saiyan
                God to fight Beerus by using the power of five Super 
                Saiyans, which includes Vegeta, Gohan, Goten, Trunks, and
                the baby named Pan in Videl's womb. Despite losing, Goku's 
                efforts appease the God of Destruction enough that he decides 
                to spare the planet.
            </p>
            <p class="text-light">
                While Goku and Vegeta leave with Beerus and Whis to train for a 
                year, the remaining remnants of Frieza's army arrive on Earth in 
                search for the Dragon Balls to revive Frieza. A few months after 
                coming back to life and training, Frieza gathers his forces and 
                returns to enact his revenge on Goku. Despite achieving a new 
                transformation, he is defeated by Goku and Vegeta, who have both 
                mastered the Super Saiyan God Super Saiyan transformation. 
                Frieza blows up the Earth in retaliation. However, with Whis's 
                ability to manipulate time, Goku is able to destroy Frieza once 
                again.

                Champa, Beerus' brother and the God of Destruction of Universe 
                Six, convinces Beerus to hold a tournament between the best 
                fighters from each god's universe for the possession of Earth. 
                Goku and his friends join the tournament. Each match in the 
                tournament shows different surprises and abilities. The 
                tournament reaches its climax in the second-to-last match 
                between Goku and Hit. After a failed attempt to lift the rules 
                to face Hit in his full power, Goku forfeits the match. However, 
                Hit forfeits the final match since he was inspired by Goku to do 
                the same thing. The tournament concludes with Universe Seven's 
                victory.

                Goku later meets and befriends Present Grand Zenō, who is the 
                king and emperor of all universes. Goku promises to bring him 
                a friend to play with. Later, Future Trunks reappears and brings 
                bad news of a new and powerful enemy that is a counterpart of 
                Goku, who is known as Goku Black. Goku and the others eventually 
                discover that Goku Black is actually a Supreme Kai apprentice 
                from Universe Ten named Zamasu, who hijacked Goku's body from a 
                different world as part of his plan to attain immortality and 
                wipe out all mortals. In the end after a long ultimate battle, 
                Zamasu is erased from existence along with the entire future 
                world by Future Grand Zenō, who accompanies Goku back to his 
                world. Goku fulfills his promise to Present Grand Zenō by 
                introducing him to his future self.

            <p class="text-light">
                Some time after Future Trunks returns home, Present Grand Zenō 
                and Future Grand Zenō hold a new tournament called the Tournament 
                of Power. At Goku's suggestion, the multiverse tournament features 
                teams of fighters from eight of the twelve universes. However, it 
                becomes a battle for survival when both kings declare that the 
                universes defeated at the tournament will be erased. Goku, 
                Vegeta, Gohan, Krillin, Android 17, Android 18, Piccolo, Tien, 
                Master Roshi, and a revived Frieza join the tournament as 
                representatives for Universe Seven to protect it. The Universe 
                Seven team must battle against many formidable warriors from the 
                other universes such as Universe Eleven's Pride Trooper leader 
                named Jiren. During the fight, Goku briefly attains a new godly 
                form known as Ultra Instinct (身勝手の極意 Migatte no Gokui), which 
                increases his agility and power and allows him to simultaneously 
                attack and dodge without having to think of the latter. The 
                tournament ends with Goku and Frieza taking Jiren down along 
                with themselves, which leaves Android 17 as the last remaining 
                fighter and the winner of the Tournament of Power. He is awarded 
                one wish from the Super Dragon Balls, which he uses to restore 
                all of the erased universes. The Grand Minister revealed that 
                Present Grand Zenō and Future Grand Zenō expected the universes 
                to be restored. If the wish was used for selfish purposes then 
                Present Grand Zenō and Future Grand Zenō would have erased all 
                of existence. For his efforts in the Tournament of Power, Frieza 
                is fully revived and rebuilds his army. Goku and his friends 
                return to their daily lives on Earth. While sparring, Goku reveals 
                to Vegeta that he is unable to activate Ultra Instinct again. 
                Goku and Vegeta pledge to get even stronger and become more 
                powerful.
